# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Dependency

### `React Bootstrap`

Only one dependency was installed in this app and that is react bootstrap for easy styling and responsiveness.

#### How Code Works

Firstly the code runs with react hooks i.e  it allows the use of lifecycle methods with functions instead of using classes. After the end point is created to get the data from the api, it was then passes through to the card component where it was mapped through to be displayed. 
A button was also created to be able to view the second page also.
